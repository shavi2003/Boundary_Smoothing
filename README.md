# Boundary_Smoothing


The project aims to show the research done towards boundary smoothing of megapixels, which were created as a result of an implementation of the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering Algorithm (shortly: SLIC) and its modifications.

The Research's supervised by Dr. Andreas Alpers from the University of Liverpool and implemented by Shavarsh Melikyan (MEng Engineering Mathematics student) from the University of Bristol.
